## astro-loader-i18n ðŸ—º

I'm excited to share what I've been working on for the past few weeks: an Astro loader that simplifies the process of managing internationalization (i18n) in your Astro projects. This loader allows you to easily **parse locales from file names and folder structures based on glob patterns**, making it a breeze to **handle multiple languages** when your content is based on files.

It is the first time I feel like to have something to contribute to the Astro community, and I hope you find it useful! ðŸ™Œ

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out. I'm always open to suggestions and improvements. You can find the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/openscript/astro-loader-i18n). Disclaimer: I'm better at writing code than designing websites or infographics ðŸ˜…

There are already a few projects around using it, and I would love to see more! If you want to see it in action, check out my [Astro Theme International](https://github.com/openscript/astro-theme-international).
